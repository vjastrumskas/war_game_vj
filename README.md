Project Assignment: War Card Game

Create a deck of cards, including 2 Jokers.
Define card values, with the Joker being the strongest and 2 being the weakest.
Shuffle the deck.
Deal an equal number of cards to each player.
Each player makes a move by drawing the top card of the deck. Follow these conditions:
a. The player with the higher card takes both cards and places them in a separate deck.
b. If a player runs out of cards, they take the other deck, shuffle it, and continue the game.
c. If both players draw the same card, a war begins. Both players draws three more cards and flips the forth. The player with higher card takes the cards from deck.
d. If cards tie again during the war, repeat the procedure named in c.
f. If a player doesn't have any cards to place down, because the player has run out of cards, the player loses.
